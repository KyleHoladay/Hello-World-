# Project Title 
**My First Repository**
## Description 
In my first repository, I decided to mess around with numerous markdown synax to diversify formatting and writing. Some findings and discoveries include how to create different level headings, <ins>underline</ins> and ~~cross out text~~, **bold** and *italicise text*, and <sub>subscript</sub> and <sup>superscript</sup> text. I ejoyed experimenting with the different tools and features throughout Grithub, and it was an extremely enjoyable and pleasing experience.
